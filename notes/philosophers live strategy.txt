Some thoughts:
- I figured that if you want philosophers to not die, 
you have to give them a bit more time to sleep than time to eat
then the test like:

./philo 200 200 60 80

runs smooothly.

So basically if you want everyone to stay alive you have to make the time to die to be at least:
time_to_die = time_to_eat * 2 + time_to_sleep

200 = 60 * 2 + 80

then it works. If you give it less - someone will die
